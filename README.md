## 📊 Private Footfall & Analytics Tracking

Traffic and visitor footfall are tracked privately using **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)**. 
- **100% Private**: No counters or badges are shown on the website. Only you (logged into your Google Analytics account) can view visitor counts, live footfalls, and page popularity.
- **SPA Route Tracking**: Accurately counts visits across specific courses and quiz weeks.

### Setting Up Your Measurement ID:
1. Create a free property at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com) and copy your **Measurement ID** (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`).
2. Add it to your `.env` file (or your hosting platform's environment variables):
   ```env
   VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```
   *(Alternatively, paste it into `src/config/analytics.js`)*
3. Rebuild and deploy!
